# 3DGAN-tail_rotor

3DGAN Updated for 3D rotor tail
This repository contains a simplified version of the code used in our study, based on an updated version of a 3DGAN repository tailored for 3D rotor tail generation. We express our gratitude to the [original repository's author](https://github.com/xchhuang/simple-pytorch-3dgan.git) for their foundational work. 

Note:
The code provided here is a streamlined version of what was used in the study for the sake of clarity and ease of use. Some advanced features or specific customizations might be omitted.

Updates:
Updated libraries and dependencies.
Algorithm optimization for 3D rotor tail generation.
Additional documentation for data transformations

Manuscript Reference:
This updated and simplified code has been utilized in a manuscript currently under peer review.
